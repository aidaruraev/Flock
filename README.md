We want to connect students with initiatives (led by peers) on campus to make opportunities more accessible. In order to succeed in college, students have to pursue extracurriculars and gain experience. People should be able to take full advantage of resources at their institutions, instead of it being hidden away in niche areas. By creating a centralized hub of initiatives and projects to improve your skills and contribute to your community in a positive way.

Through a user-friendly interface of a campus, students are able to navigate four different subject areas: humanities, arts & music, STEM, and finance. From there, they can select the subject they are interested in and access a curated feed of available projects in that area. Each project contains a description, progress images, and current members. Users can click on the project to access a discussion board. These allow them to interact with members to possibly form a team. Any student can create and invite their peers to join their projects.

The incentives are to gain community points for your virtual campus base through individual and group contributions. Your campus base will expand and look cooler while also being highlighted on the virtual global map. All participating schools will have a chance to be featured. Students will gain recognition for contributing to their community projects. In the future, we hope to partner with company sponsors and organizations for these incentives. They will be able to access more opportunities, perks, and events for their school.
