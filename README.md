Final Idea: website that allows people to connect with student initiatives on campus 

Explanation: we want to connect students with other student initiatives in order to promote opportunity accessibility. In order to succeed in college, students have to pursue extracurriculars and gain experience. People should be able to take full advantage of resources at their institutions, instead of it being hidden away in niche areas. By creating a centralized hub of resources, initiatives, and projects to get your name on the grid, improve your skills and contribute to your community in a positive way.
